Death in the Afternoon

This is an app designed to look like a POS system for ordering drinks at a bar. It has the ability to choose a drink, pulls up the contents of the drink and instructions for the bartender to make the drink. Once the made, the bartender clicks the add to cart to be sent back to the home page where one can choose another drink, go to the cart, or review orders if some are already placed and finalized.

The cart page has a list of the current items in the order and prices accordingly. The finalize order button clears the drinks here and places an object in local storage to be reviewed later if desired.
The clear button clears the order items to then repopulate with new items from the home page.

We used a cocktails api to get information about each cocktail. We selected 6 items to make the coding easier instead of the 100 drinks in the API.

The prices were designed based on ingredients and type of liquor and put into each drink object hard.

We had a slew of things we wanted to get to but could not due to time. This includes puting in a litebox on the first page to hover over each thumbnail of the drinks to give a zoomed in effect. Another feature we tried to get to was the adjusting the quanties on the cart page so you wouldnt have to start a new order to update the order.

Enjoy the cocktails!!
